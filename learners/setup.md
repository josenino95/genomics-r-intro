This lesson is an additional lesson to [the genomics workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/). If you are only here for the Intro to R and RStudio for Genomics lesson you can go for option B below where you will only need to [download the data files](https://figshare.com/articles/Data_Carpentry_Genomics_beta_2_0/7726454) to your local working directory where you will create the r-project in.


## Installing R

Typically we suggest you install R for your operating system. Instructions from Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at [this page](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Installing RStudio

The RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) is a popular way to use R. We will cover what RStudio is in the lesson. All operating systems can go to the Posit LLC [download pages](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to download the appropriate version for their operating system. In most cases, the Posit website will detect your operating system and suggest the correct download. This same page will link to alternatives.
